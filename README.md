This is a Simple Student Report-card System in PHP/Mysql intended to help programmers new to Php. This project is free and you can edit and add some new cool features as you may wish. With this simple project, IT/CS students or anyone who is learning PHP will learn some useful techniques and methods for their future PHP Project Development. I develop this web application using HTML, PHP, MySQL database, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the design. The system has a simple user interface and has user-friendly functionalities. The source code is easy to read and easy to learn. I have also used Ajax in some features of this project so that you can also learn how to use it to give your future end-users a better experience when using your PHP Web Application.<br>
